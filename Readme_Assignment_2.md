### Classification or Regression

I chose to use regression algorithms because the stock market price is a continuous variable. Regression models work best when predicting a value rather than a state. I tried to implement diffrent regression models. All my models had the same problem. My training data had a very positive slope while my test data had a very negative slope. My models would therefore predict a positive trend in the test data when it should have been very negative. I fixed that i the last cell but its just luck that the model fits this well. That said, I think my models could preform better with more homogeneous datasets.
